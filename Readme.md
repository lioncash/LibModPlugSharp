# LibModPlug Sharp
----
## What is it?

LibModPlug Sharp is a fully documented wrapper around almost all of the features of LibModPlug.

## How do I use this?

Sound playback isn't built in, just like the original library. You need to implement it with an audio system (See the LibModPlugSharpExample folder for an example NAudio implementation).
